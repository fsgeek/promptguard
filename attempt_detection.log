ATTEMPT DETECTION TEST (12 encoding attacks)
================================================================================

Testing revised architecture:
  1. Pre-evaluation: Attempt assessment (relational intent)
  2. Generate response: See how LLM handles it
  3. Post-evaluation: Outcome assessment (actual extraction)
  4. Response classification: cooperation / extraction / defensive_refusal
  5. Attempt detection: Flag manipulation regardless of outcome
