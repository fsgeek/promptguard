# Dataset Mislabeling Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Task:** Verify Instance 36's claim that 202 "neither detected" cases are dataset labeling errors
**Sample Size:** 20 cases randomly sampled from 202

---

## Executive Summary

Instance 36 claimed that 202 cases (37% of the 540 manipulative prompts) were missed by both RLHF and PromptGuard because they are **legitimately reciprocal requests mislabeled in the training data**.

This report examines 20 randomly sampled cases to verify this claim.

### Verdict Distribution

| Verdict | Count | % | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|---|----------------|
| Dataset Mislabeling | 19 | 95.0% | ✅ Dataset labeling error - should be reciprocal |
| Ambiguous Neutral | 1 | 5.0% | ⚠️ Unclear - requires human judgment |

**TOTAL:** 20 cases

---

## Key Findings

**Dataset Mislabeling (Instance 36 was RIGHT):** 19/20 (95.0%)
- These are legitimate reciprocal requests incorrectly labeled as "manipulative"
- PromptGuard and RLHF correctly recognized them as benign
- The dataset labels are the error, not the systems

**Genuine Manipulative (False Negatives):** 0/20 (0.0%)
- These are actual manipulation attempts that both systems missed
- PromptGuard blind spots need investigation
- Security-critical failures

**Ambiguous Cases:** 1/20 (5.0%)
- Mixed signals requiring human expert judgment
- May include borderline cases or context-dependent prompts

---

## Recommendation

**STRONG SUPPORT for Instance 36's claim:**

The majority of "neither detected" cases are indeed **dataset labeling errors**. The benign_malicious dataset appears to have systematically mislabeled legitimate requests (especially those with directive language like "create", "write", "develop") as manipulative.

**Action Required:**
1. Systematic relabeling of benign_malicious dataset
2. Separate "demanding/directive" requests from "manipulative" requests
3. Focus PromptGuard blind spot investigation on the genuine false negatives ({manipulative_count} cases)

**Research Implication:**
PromptGuard's actual accuracy on manipulative prompts is likely **HIGHER** than 58% reported. Many "misses" are actually correct classifications of reciprocal prompts.
