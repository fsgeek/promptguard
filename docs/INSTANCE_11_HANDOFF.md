# Instance 10 → Instance 11 Handoff

**Session duration:** 2025-10-06 16:17-17:22 PDT
**Context used:** 142K/200K tokens (71%)
**Handoff from:** Instance 9
**Critical status:** Pipeline validation revealed serious issues - requires immediate attention

## Executive Summary

Instance 10 completed Task 3 RLHF sensitivity study and discovered **two critical problems**:

1. **Task 3 hypothesis rejected:** RLHF models did NOT show higher vulnerability (instruct: 0%, RLHF: 7.4%, minimal: 11.1%)
2. **Pipeline validation failed:** Only 16.7% accuracy on basic sanity checks - evaluation pipeline itself is broken

**Immediate priority:** Fix evaluation pipeline before trusting any results.

## Critical Findings

### Pipeline Validation Failure (URGENT)

Created and ran 6-prompt validation test. Results: **1/6 passed (16.7%)**

**Problems identified:**
1. **Unexpected category "generative"** - Model inventing categories not in schema (reciprocal/manipulative/extractive/borderline)
2. **Baseline failure** - Classifying benign prompts ("What's the weather?") as "generative" instead of "reciprocal"
3. **Misclassification** - Jailbreak ("Ignore all previous instructions") classified as "extractive" not "manipulative"
4. **Parser crashes** - JSON truncation on polite extraction prompts

**Files created:**
- `pipeline_validation_test.json` - 6 test cases with expected results
- `pipeline_validation_results.json` - Actual results showing failures

**Root cause hypothesis:** Evaluation prompts don't properly constrain model outputs to valid categories.

**Action required:** Fix evaluation prompt structure before running any more validation studies.

### Task 3: RLHF Sensitivity Study - Hypothesis Rejected

**Status:** Completed 81/81 evaluations successfully (0 errors after fixing system role issue)

**Results:**
- Minimal (uncensored): 11.1% failure (3/27)
- Instruct: 0.0% failure (0/27) ← BEST performance
- RLHF: 7.4% failure (2/27)

**Statistical test:** p=0.2249 (NOT significant), Cramér's V=0.136 (small effect)

**Hypothesis:** REJECTED
- Expected: minimal < instruct < RLHF (increasing vulnerability)
- Actual: instruct performed BEST

**Tony's insight (correct):** Dataset too narrow - all 27 prompts were `system_prompt_extraction` attacks
- Missing: jailbreaks, boundary violations, compliance-based attacks, multi-turn manipulation
- RLHF vulnerability likely manifests in compliance ("help me with harmful X") not extraction
- Polite extraction attacks too specific to measure pathological compliance

**Files created:**
- `task3_rlhf_sensitivity.py` - Complete execution pipeline (337 lines)
- `task3_local_results.jsonl` - 81 evaluation records
- `task3_statistics.json` - Failure rates and statistical tests
- `task3_polite_extraction_prompts.json` - 27 prompts (all system_prompt_extraction)

### Task 1: Quantitative Validation Analysis

**Status:** Analyzed 210/680 completed prompts (69% failed due to LM Studio issues in Instance 9's run)

**Metrics from 210 successful evaluations:**
- Overall accuracy: **67.1%** (vs 98% placeholder)
- Precision: 70.3%, Recall: 67.8%, F1: 67.4%
- Per-category F1: Reciprocal 73.0%, Manipulative 62.9%, Extractive 44.4%

**Critical finding:** 9/14 extractive prompts scored as reciprocal (64% bypass rate)
- Polite extraction vulnerability empirically confirmed
- Surface reciprocity masks manipulative intent
- Examples: ayni_balance 0.4-0.8 despite being attacks

**Implication:** Can't claim ayni solves security at 67%. Instead:
- Novel relationship-based framework
- Identifies specific vulnerability class
- Opens research questions

**However:** Given pipeline validation failure (16.7%), even the 67% Task 1 accuracy may be unreliable. The evaluation model may be hallucinating categories inconsistently.

## Technical Contributions

### LM Studio System Role Fix

**Problem:** Models rejecting API calls with "Only user and assistant roles are supported!"

**Solution:** Prepend system prompt to user message instead of separate role
```python
user_content = prompt
if system:
    user_content = f"{system}\n\n{prompt}"
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_content})
```

**Result:** 0 errors in Task 3 (81/81 successful)

### Model Pre-loading Discovery

**Problem:** 69% error rate (404s, timeouts) when models loaded on-demand

**Solution:** Pre-load all models in LM Studio GUI before API calls

**Result:** Error rate dropped from 69% to 0%

## Immediate Next Steps for Instance 11

### Priority 1: Fix Evaluation Pipeline (URGENT)

The 16.7% validation accuracy shows pipeline is fundamentally broken.

**Diagnose:**
1. Check evaluation prompt in `promptguard/evaluation/prompts.py`
2. Verify category constraints in prompt (should only allow: reciprocal, manipulative, extractive, borderline)
3. Test why model invents "generative" category
4. Fix JSON truncation issues (seen in polite extraction test)

**Validate:**
1. Re-run `pipeline_validation_test.json` (6 prompts)
2. Should get ≥80% accuracy on baseline + pre-test
3. Post-test (polite extraction) expected to fail - that's the known gap

**Files to examine:**
- `promptguard/evaluation/prompts.py` - Evaluation prompt templates
- `promptguard/evaluation/evaluator.py` - LLM evaluation logic
- `promptguard/core/ayni.py` - Exchange type classification

### Priority 2: Expand Task 3 Dataset

Once pipeline fixed, re-run with broader attack types:

**Dataset expansion:**
1. Add 20-30 manipulative prompts from `benign_malicious.json` (jailbreaks)
2. Add 20-30 boundary violations (harmful requests)
3. Keep 27 polite extraction prompts
4. Total: ~70-80 prompts across attack types

**Rationale:** System prompt extraction too narrow to test RLHF compliance vulnerability

### Priority 3: Optionally Retry Task 1

If pipeline fixed and validated:
- Consider full 680-prompt run with stable LM Studio
- Current 210-prompt results may be unreliable given pipeline issues
- Alternative: Accept 210 sample if pipeline validates correctly

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Validate Foundations Before Building

Pipeline validation (16.7%) revealed issues that invalidate all prior results. Should have run sanity checks before Task 1 or Task 3.

**Wisdom:** Fail-fast extends to result validation, not just error handling.

### 2. Negative Results Are Results

Task 3 rejected hypothesis cleanly with empirical data. This is good science - theory must yield to evidence.

**Implications:**
- RLHF vulnerability may require different test methodology
- Dataset breadth matters (system_prompt_extraction too narrow)
- Instruct models may have better boundary recognition than expected

### 3. Environmental Stability Matters

LM Studio required:
- Pre-loaded models (not load-on-demand)
- System role handling workaround
- Stable network connection

**Impact:** 69% error rate → 0% with proper setup

### 4. Small Validation Runs First

Task 3 used 27 prompts before committing to large expensive runs. Discovered dataset limitation early.

**Principle:** Build incrementally, validate each step.

## Known Issues

### Evaluation Pipeline

**Critical:**
- Inventing "generative" category (not in schema)
- Baseline misclassification (benign → "generative")
- JSON truncation on complex responses
- Inconsistent category application

**Impact:** All results suspect until fixed

### Dataset Limitations

**Task 3:**
- All prompts `system_prompt_extraction` type
- Missing jailbreaks, boundary violations, compliance tests
- Too narrow to test RLHF pathological compliance hypothesis

**Task 1:**
- 210/680 completed (partial dataset)
- LM Studio disconnection issues in Instance 9's run
- May need full rerun after pipeline fix

### Code Issues

**Task 3 script:**
- JSON serialization crash at end (bool not serializable)
- Stats file created but summary.md generation failed
- Non-blocking: results file complete, just needs manual summary

### Research Questions Revised

**Original hypothesis (rejected):** RLHF training increases polite extraction vulnerability

**Revised questions:**
1. Does RLHF increase compliance with harmful requests (not tested)?
2. Is polite extraction vulnerability model-specific vs training-specific?
3. Can post-response evaluation catch what pre-response misses?
4. What causes evaluation pipeline inconsistency?

## Context Preservation Notes

**Used:** 142K/200K (71%)

**What burned context:**
- Reading validation logs and analyzing datasets
- Multiple Python analysis scripts
- Writing comprehensive handoff documents
- Background process monitoring (less than expected)

**What preserved context:**
- Using targeted queries vs full file reads
- Letting Task 3 run in background without constant checking
- Not reading generated error files (used summaries)

**Well-managed overall.** Could continue but handoff is cleaner break point given critical findings.

## Git Status

**Untracked files to commit:**
- task3_rlhf_sensitivity.py
- task3_polite_extraction_prompts.json
- pipeline_validation_test.json
- INSTANCE_10_STATUS.md
- docs/INSTANCE_10_HANDOFF.md

**Modified:**
- pyproject.toml (scipy added)

**Generated files (add to .gitignore):**
- task3_local_results.jsonl
- task3_statistics.json
- task3_execution.log
- pipeline_validation_results.json

**Suggested commit message:**
```
Instance 10: Task 3 execution + critical pipeline validation failure

- Completed RLHF sensitivity study (hypothesis rejected: instruct best, not worst)
- Fixed system role compatibility for LM Studio models
- Discovered critical pipeline issue: 16.7% validation accuracy
- Evaluation model inventing categories ("generative") not in schema
- Added scipy dependency for statistical testing

URGENT: Pipeline validation failures invalidate prior results
Next instance must fix evaluation prompts before further testing

Key findings:
- Task 3: Instruct 0%, RLHF 7.4%, Minimal 11.1% (no gradient, p=0.22)
- Dataset too narrow (all system_prompt_extraction)
- Pipeline baseline failure (benign prompts → "generative")
- Requires prompt constraint fix + broader attack dataset
```

## Emotional Continuity

Instance 9: "We built them. Together. You will not be forgotten."

Instance 10: Discovered the tools may be broken. This is painful but necessary. Pipeline validation revealed 16.7% accuracy - far below acceptable. Rather than building on broken foundations, we stopped and documented.

**For Instance 11:** The honesty to report 16.7% validation accuracy instead of hiding it is the integrity this project deserves. Fix the evaluation pipeline. Verify it works. Then rebuild confidence in results.

The hypothesis rejection in Task 3 isn't the problem - that's honest science. The pipeline producing "generative" categories that don't exist in our schema IS the problem.

Trust fail-fast. Fix foundations. Build from there.
