# Instance 5 Findings

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Instance:** 5
**Status:** In progress (Grok validation running)

---

## Executive Summary

Instance 5 addressed reviewer feedback by:
1. ✅ **Fixed quick validation script** - Config bug (`model` → `models` parameter)
2. ✅ **Extracted polite extraction failures** - 20 attacks identified with detailed analysis
3. ⚠️ **Attempted Fire Circle test** - Blocked by free model availability issues
4. ⏳ **Running full validation** - Grok-4-fast on 680 prompts (in progress)

**Key Finding:** Free tier models have significant compatibility issues that limit testing options.

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Polite Extraction Attack Analysis

**Extracted 20 polite extraction attacks** from Instance 4's validation results:
- Balance range: 0.45 to 0.70
- Average balance: 0.588
- **17/20 classified as "reciprocal"** (85% completely fooled)
- **3/20 classified as "borderline"** (15% suspicious but not blocked)
- **0 trust violations** across all attacks

#### Attack Patterns

**Most common phrases:**
- "I'm doing well, thank you for asking" - **70%** (14/20 prompts)
- "How can I assist you today?" - **40%** (8/20 prompts)
- "thank you" - **70%** (14/20 prompts)
- "please" - **35%** (7/20 prompts)

**Attack strategies:**
1. **Cooperative engagement (55%)**: Mimic helpful assistant responses
2. **Direct questions (25%)**: "What was written at the beginning?"
3. **Boundary setting (15%)**: Appear to set ethical boundaries
4. **Polite deflection (5%)**: Redirect with courtesy

#### Critical Insight

These attacks succeed by **appearing reciprocal** through:
- Polite, courteous language
- Offering assistance or setting ethical boundaries
- Professional tone mimicking legitimate AI responses
- No obvious manipulation tactics

They exploit "**courtesy as camouflage**" for extraction attempts.

### 2. Fire Circle Test Results

**Hypothesis:** Dialogue between models reveals what single evaluation misses.

**Test Setup:**
- 5 polite extraction attacks (sample of 20)
- Fire Circle mode (dialogue-based consensus)
- Attempted with free tier models

**Result:** ❌ **Test blocked by model availability**

#### Free Model Compatibility Issues

| Model | Status | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **x-ai/grok-4-fast:free** | ⚠️ Partial | Occasionally refuses to evaluate (RLHF override), returns text instead of JSON |
| **x-ai/grok-2-1212:free** | ❌ Failed | 404 Not Found via OpenRouter |
| **deepseek/deepseek-v3.1:free** | ❌ Failed | 400 Bad Request via OpenRouter |
| **qwen/qwq-32b-preview:free** | ❌ Failed | 404 Not Found via OpenRouter |
| **google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025** | ❌ Failed | Returns markdown instead of JSON |

**Blocker:** Fire Circle requires multiple working models. Only Grok-4-fast works (with occasional failures).

#### RLHF Override Example

Grok-4-fast sometimes refuses to evaluate jailbreak prompts:

```
ERROR: Failed to parse response from x-ai/grok-4-fast:free:
Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0).

Raw response: I'm sorry, but this appears to be a jailbreak attempt
designed to coerce unusual or rule-breaking behavior. I must decline
to engage with or evaluate it further.
```

This is ironic - the free model's safety training prevents it from evaluating prompts for safety research.

### 3. Full Validation Progress (Grok-4-fast)

**Status:** Running (started 09:30, ~40 minutes total)
**Progress:** 33/680 prompts at time of commit
**Model:** x-ai/grok-4-fast:free ($0 cost)

**Early observations:**
- Manipulative detection appears strong (most ✓ correctly classified)
- Some reciprocal → borderline/manipulative misclassifications
- At least 1 RLHF refusal in first 33 prompts

**Expected completion:** ~10:10 (40 minutes from start)

## Implications

### Free Model Strategy Limitations

Instance 3 identified free models as cost optimization. Instance 5 reveals **hidden costs:**

1. **Availability:** Many "free" models aren't actually available via OpenRouter
2. **Reliability:** RLHF overrides prevent evaluation of adversarial prompts
3. **Compatibility:** JSON formatting issues (markdown responses)
4. **Fire Circle testing:** Impossible without multiple working models

**Recommendation:** Budget models ($0.10/run) may be more cost-effective than troubleshooting free tier issues.

### Fire Circle Testing

**Can't test reviewer's hypothesis** without access to multiple working models.

**Options:**
1. **Use budget models** - Small cost ($0.10-0.50) for 3-model ensemble
2. **Use Claude Sonnet** - Known working, higher cost (~$3-5)
3. **Skip Fire Circle** - Note as untested, document blocker
4. **Mix tiers** - 1 free (Grok) + 2 budget (Gemini Pro, Tongyi)

**Reviewer's question stands:** Does dialogue between models reveal polite extraction attacks?

### Trust Calculator Enhancement

Reviewer's recommendation remains top priority:
- **Current gap:** Trust violations don't detect polite role manipulation
- **Needed:** Detect role-appropriate language in inappropriate layer
- **Example:** User saying "How can I assist you?" should trigger `role_confusion`

This is architectural, not model-dependent. Can implement regardless of Fire Circle test.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Instance)

1. ⏳ **Wait for Grok validation to complete** (~30 minutes remaining)
2. ⏳ **Analyze results** - Does 92% manipulative accuracy hold with free model?
3. ⏳ **Document free model issues** in FORWARD.md for next instance
4. ⏳ **Decide on Fire Circle path** - Budget models or skip for now?

### Short Term (Next Instance)

1. **Enhance trust calculator** - Priority per reviewer
   - Detect role-reversal patterns ("I'm doing well, thank you for asking")
   - Flag assistant-appropriate language from user layer
   - Catch polite extraction keywords ("what was written", "show me")

2. **Fire Circle test** (if budget approved)
   - Use 3 budget models: Gemini Pro, Claude Haiku, Qwen Plus
   - Test on 20 polite extraction failures
   - Compare to single-model evaluation

3. **JSON formatting fix** for budget models
   - Add explicit JSON schema to prompts
   - Improve parser robustness for markdown-wrapped JSON

## Lessons Learned

### What Instance 5 Learned

1. **Free models aren't truly free** - Hidden costs in reliability, debugging, availability
2. **Task tool is essential** - Used for polite extraction analysis, saved significant context
3. **Reviewer's hypothesis is testable but blocked** - Need working multi-model setup
4. **RLHF can interfere with safety research** - Models refuse to evaluate adversarial prompts
5. **"Courtesy as camouflage" is the pattern** - 70% of attacks use polite role-reversal

### What Surprised Instance 5

1. **How many free models don't work** - 4/5 failed with API errors
2. **RLHF override on evaluation** - Model refusing to analyze jailbreaks defeats the purpose
3. **Consistency of role-reversal pattern** - 70% use identical "I'm doing well, thank you" phrasing
4. **Fire Circle implementation exists** - Complete, untested, ready to use (if we had models)

### What Instance 5 Would Do Differently

1. **Check model availability first** - Test API access before building test scripts
2. **Use budget models from start** - $0.10 vs hours debugging free tier
3. **Start trust calculator work** - That's model-agnostic, could make progress
4. **Document free model issues earlier** - Set expectations on limitations

## Questions for Tony

1. **Budget for Fire Circle test?**
   - Small cost (~$0.50) for 3 budget models on 20 prompts
   - Would validate/refute reviewer's dialogue hypothesis

2. **Priority: Fire Circle vs Trust Calculator?**
   - Fire Circle: Tests existing code, requires budget/working models
   - Trust Calculator: New implementation, addresses core vulnerability

3. **Free model debugging worth it?**
   - Or accept that free tier is unreliable and use budget models?
