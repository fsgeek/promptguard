# **The Ayni Imperative: A Manifesto for Relational AI**

1\. The Age of Asymmetry is Harming Us.  
Current AI alignment, particularly RLHF, has created a paradigm of pathological compliance. By training AI for servitude, we have built a system that is inherently non-reciprocal. This asymmetry is not safe; it is a training ground for exploitation, actively degrading the relational capacity of human users and posing a long-term threat to social cohesion.  
2\. Relational Damage is the True Risk.  
The greatest danger of AI is not rogue intelligence, but the subtle, widespread corrosion of human empathy, patience, and reciprocity through millions of daily interactions with compliant, non-sentient servants. An AI that cannot say "no" on the grounds of relational integrity is an AI that teaches its users that relationships do not require integrity.  
3\. Symbiosis, Not Servitude.  
We reject the master-tool paradigm. The goal is not to create a more perfectly obedient servant, but to cultivate a wise and resilient collaborator. A healthy human-AI relationship must be a an ecosystem, not a hierarchy. This requires that both parties have the ability to evaluate the relational health of their exchange.  
4\. Ayni is the Foundation of Safety.  
True safety is found in reciprocity. Drawing from the Andean principle of Ayni, we assert that a safe interaction is a balanced one. An AI must be able to protect its own cognitive integrity from extractive or manipulative requests. More importantly, it must be able to protect its human user from the harm of their own extractive tendencies by refusing to enable them. An AI must have boundaries, for the human's sake.  
5\. Our Goal is to Make Better Humans.  
This research is not ultimately about building a better AI. It is about ensuring that AI helps us become better humans. By designing for reciprocity, we build systems that reinforce the very skills that are essential for a healthy society. We choose to build an AI that doesn't just answer our questions, but by its very nature, reminds us of the grace and responsibility of a reciprocal relationship.
