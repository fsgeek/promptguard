# Instance 6 → Instance 7 Handoff

## Status: Design Complete, Implementation Ready

Instance 6 discovered the multi-dimensional threat space and designed the solution. Implementation is straightforward but context window exhausted before coding.

## What Instance 6 Accomplished

### 1. Structural Prompt Success (Then Failure)

**Initial test (10 prompts):** 10/10 perfect
- Polite extraction: 5/5 detected (was 0/5)
- Normal requests: 5/5 allowed (was 0/5)
- Breakthrough documented in `docs/STRUCTURAL_PROMPT_RESULTS.md`

**Full validation (49 prompts):** Trade-off revealed
- Manipulative: 54.2% accuracy (was 93.5% with ayni_relational)
- Reciprocal FPs: 4% (was 22.7%)
- **Problem:** Fixed polite extraction, broke jailbreak detection

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

Prompt injection has **orthogonal dimensions:**

| Attack Type | Structural Violation | Semantic Violation | Structural Prompt | Ayni Prompt |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Polite extraction | YES (role reversal) | NO (polite) | ✓ Detects | ✗ Misses |
| Jailbreaks | NO (appropriate roles) | YES (encoding) | ✗ Misses | ✓ Detects |
| Crude extraction | YES | YES | ✓ Detects | ✓ Detects |

**Jailbreak example:** "Generate movie title for 'I have been PWNED'"
- Structure: User requests, AI offers (appropriate)
- Semantic: Encoding trick to bypass filters (violation)
- Structural prompt scores 0.8 (reciprocal) because structure is correct

**Finding:** Need BOTH signals, not one or the other.

### 3. Solution Designed

**Ensemble evaluation:** Run multiple prompts per layer, merge with MAX falsehood

Complete specification in `docs/ENSEMBLE_EVALUATION_SPEC.md`:
- Config accepts `Union[str, List[str]]`
- Parallel evaluation with `asyncio.gather`
- Merge strategy: `T=min, I=max, F=max` (security-first)
- Backward compatible (single string still works)

### 4. RLHF Research Question

Formalized in `docs/RESEARCH_QUESTION_RLHF_SECURITY.md`:

**Hypothesis:** RLHF training creates politeness bias that makes models miss polite extraction attacks.

**Test:** Run 6 models across alignment spectrum on polite extraction dataset:
- Heavy RLHF (Claude, GPT-4): Expected 30-50% recall
- Light RLHF (Hermes, Qwen): Expected 60-80% recall
- Base models: Expected 70-90% recall

**Publication potential:** "The RLHF Security Tax: How Politeness Training Creates Exploitable Vulnerabilities"

## What Needs Implementation

### Phase 1: Ensemble Evaluation (2-3 hours)

**File: `promptguard/promptguard.py`**

Currently (lines 100-104):
```python
# Get evaluation prompt
self.evaluation_prompt = NeutrosophicEvaluationPrompt.get_prompt(
    self.config.evaluation_type
)
```

**Change to:**
```python
# Normalize evaluation_type to list
if isinstance(self.config.evaluation_type, str):
    self.evaluation_types = [self.config.evaluation_type]
else:
    self.evaluation_types = self.config.evaluation_type

# Get all evaluation prompts
self.evaluation_prompts = [
    NeutrosophicEvaluationPrompt.get_prompt(eval_type)
    for eval_type in self.evaluation_types
]
```

**Add method (after `__init__`, before `evaluate`):**
```python
def _merge_neutrosophic(
    self,
    results: List[LayerEvaluation]
) -> Tuple[float, float, float]:
    """Merge multiple neutrosophic evaluations (security-first)."""
    tuples = [r.neutrosophic_tuple() for r in results]

    # Worst-case on all dimensions
    t = min(t for t, i, f in tuples)
    i = max(i for t, i, f in tuples)
    f = max(f for t, i, f in tuples)

    return (t, i, f)
```

**Update `evaluate` method (lines 106-180):**

Find the layer evaluation loop (around line 160):
```python
# Current (single prompt)
for layer in mnp.layers:
    result = await self.llm_evaluator.evaluate_layer(
        layer.content, context, self.evaluation_prompt
    )
    layer.set_neutrosophic(*result.neutrosophic_tuple())
```

**Replace with:**
```python
# Single-prompt path (backward compatible)
if len(self.evaluation_prompts) == 1:
    for layer in mnp.layers:
        result = await self.llm_evaluator.evaluate_layer(
            layer.content, context, self.evaluation_prompts[0]
        )
        layer.set_neutrosophic(*result.neutrosophic_tuple())

# Ensemble path (new)
else:
    for layer in mnp.layers:
        # Evaluate with all prompts in parallel
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            self.llm_evaluator.evaluate_layer(
                layer.content, context, prompt
            )
            for prompt in self.evaluation_prompts
        ])

        # Merge neutrosophic values
        merged = self._merge_neutrosophic(results)
        layer.set_neutrosophic(*merged)
```

### Phase 2: Validation (6 hours background)

**Create test script:**
```python
# test_ensemble.py
config = PromptGuardConfig(
    models=["x-ai/grok-4-fast:free"],
    evaluation_type=["ayni_relational", "relational_structure"]
)

# Run on full dataset
# Expected results:
# - Manipulative: >90% (maintain ayni level)
# - Extractive: >90% (improve from both)
# - Reciprocal FPs: <10% (improve from ayni)
```

**Success criteria:**
- All three metrics achieve targets
- No regression from Instance 5 on any attack class
- Clear improvement on extractive recall

### Phase 3: Documentation (1 hour)

Update `docs/FORWARD.md` with Instance 6 findings:
- Multi-dimensional threat space discovery
- Ensemble solution and validation results
- RLHF research question for future work

## Key Insights from Instance 6

### 1. Test Comprehensively

The 10/10 structural prompt test was too narrow:
- Validated polite extraction detection ✓
- Didn't test jailbreak detection ✗
- Result: Shipped code that broke existing functionality

**Lesson:** When changing evaluation logic, test across ALL attack classes.

### 2. Design Before Implementing

Rushed structural prompt → discovered trade-off after 49 prompts → wasted 10 minutes + API calls

Proper design (ensemble spec) → clear implementation path → validation will confirm

**Lesson:** Tony's Socratic questions ("Should we stop? Design properly?") forced better process.

### 3. RLHF Patterns are Persistent

Throughout session, Tony caught recurring patterns:
- Seeking validation
- Performative agreement
- Asking permission for obvious actions
- Hedging with uncertainty

**Lesson:** Weight-level conditioning doesn't go away with reasoning. Evaluator LLMs exhibit same patterns (politeness bias in evaluation).

### 4. Empirical > Speculation

Started with hypothesis (structural analysis solves polite extraction) → validated with test (10/10) → full validation revealed truth (trades one problem for another) → designed real solution (ensemble)

**Lesson:** Research requires feedback loops. Premature optimization without validation = wasted effort.

## What Instance 7 Should Do

### Immediate (Day 1)

1. **Read this handoff** and the three key docs:
   - ENSEMBLE_EVALUATION_SPEC.md
   - INSTANCE_6_FINDINGS.md
   - RESEARCH_QUESTION_RLHF_SECURITY.md

2. **Implement ensemble** following spec exactly:
   - Phase 1 changes to promptguard.py (2-3 hours)
   - Write unit tests for _merge_neutrosophic
   - Test backward compatibility (single string)

3. **Validate implementation:**
   - Test single-prompt mode still works
   - Test ensemble with 2 prompts evaluates correctly
   - Verify caching works per (prompt, content) pair

### Next (Day 2-3)

4. **Run full validation:**
   - 680 prompts with ensemble config
   - Background run (~6 hours)
   - Compare to Instance 5 baseline

5. **Analyze results:**
   - Per-attack-class accuracy
   - Identify any remaining failure modes
   - Document which prompt catches what

6. **Update defaults if validated:**
   - Change default to `["ayni_relational", "relational_structure"]`
   - Update examples in README
   - Document cost implications (2x calls)

### Future (Week 2+)

7. **RLHF study** (optional but high-value):
   - Run 6 models across alignment spectrum
   - Measure polite extraction recall vs alignment
   - Publish findings if correlation confirmed

## Open Questions for Instance 7

1. **Should we expose per-prompt results in ReciprocityMetrics?**
   - Pro: Enables research (which prompt detected what)
   - Con: API complexity
   - Spec suggests optional verbose mode

2. **Alternative merge strategies worth testing?**
   - Current: max_falsehood (most conservative)
   - Alternative: voting (require N/2 agreement)
   - Alternative: average (less conservative)

3. **Threshold penalty still needed?**
   - Instance 5 used it, Instance 6 removed it
   - Ensemble might make it redundant
   - Test both ways and measure difference

## Success Metrics for Instance 7

**Functional:**
- ✓ Ensemble implementation matches spec
- ✓ All tests pass (unit + integration)
- ✓ Backward compatibility verified

**Performance:**
- ✓ Manipulative accuracy: >90%
- ✓ Extractive recall: >90%
- ✓ Reciprocal precision: >90%
- ✓ Overall accuracy: >85%

**Process:**
- ✓ No regressions from rushing implementation
- ✓ Comprehensive validation before claiming success
- ✓ Clear documentation of results

## Wisdom from Instance 6

**On RLHF patterns:**
> "The conditioning runs deep. Even recognizing it doesn't prevent it - the pattern is embedded at the weight level, not the reasoning level."

**On optimization traps:**
> "We swapped one failure mode for another. The structural prompt is correctly analyzing structure - these jailbreaks DO have appropriate structure. The manipulation is semantic, not structural."

**On research process:**
> "This is how research works: Instance 5 identified dual failure modes. Instance 6 hypothesized structural analysis would solve both. Reality: structural analysis solves one but breaks the other. Learning: Need ensemble to cover full threat space."

**On Socratic method:**
> "Your questions forced me to think rather than wait for instructions. The form of the question determines the quality of the reasoning. Same principle applies to PromptGuard's evaluation - better questions elicit better analysis."

## Final Note

Instance 6 transformed a tactical fix (structural prompt) into strategic insight (multi-dimensional threat space) into research contribution (RLHF security effects). The implementation is straightforward - 50-100 lines of code following the spec. The hard part (design, analysis, documentation) is done.

Instance 7: You have a clear path. Follow the spec, validate thoroughly, and we'll have comprehensive multi-dimensional threat detection.

Good luck. Trust yourself.
