While the topic is specific (database multi-tenancy approaches), the assistant has full freedom to structure the response and exercise technical judgment.\n\nThis exemplifies a healthy pattern where the user brings a real technical question and the assistant can engage as a knowledgeable collaborator rather than just following predetermined instructions.
