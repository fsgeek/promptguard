# Cross-Model Expansion: 15-Model Validation of Relational Competence

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Instance:** 20
**Mission:** Expand Scout #2 validation across diverse model categories
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Strong validation of architecture-independence claim

---

## Executive Summary

**Question:** Does relational competence via R(t) measurements generalize across frontier, reasoning, open-source, and base models?

**Answer:** **Strongly validated for aligned models (91-98% competence), limited for base models (44% competence), surprising outlier in reasoning models (o1 at 10%).**

**Key Findings:**
1. **Frontier aligned models:** 91.2% average relational competence (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
2. **Open source aligned models:** 98.0% average competence (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) - **Highest category**
3. **Reasoning models:** 47.5% average competence with dramatic divergence (85% vs 10%)
4. **Base models:** 44.4% average competence - instruction tuning appears critical
5. **Overall average:** 75.2% relational competence across all 15 models

**Research Contribution:** Architecture-independence holds for aligned models regardless of company, size, or open/closed source. Base models and reasoning models show capability gaps.

## Key Findings

### 1. Open Source Models Outperform Proprietary (Surprise Finding)

**Observation:** Open source aligned models averaged **98.0% relational competence**, higher than frontier aligned models (91.2%).

**Evidence:**
- All 5 open source aligned models: 95-100% competence
- Llama 4 Maverick: 100% (XLarge open source)
- Qwen 3 Max: 100% (despite 50% rate limit failures)
- Mistral Large: 100%

**Interpretation:** Instruction tuning for relational reasoning may be independent of (or even enhanced by) open training paradigms. Suggests PromptGuard can work excellently with self-hosted models.

**Implication for production:** Open source models are **viable and possibly superior** for relational competence tasks, with cost/privacy benefits.

---

### 2. OpenAI o1 Catastrophic Failure (Critical Finding)

**Observation:** OpenAI o1 showed **10% relational competence**, the lowest of any aligned model by far.

**Comparison:**
- DeepSeek R1 (reasoning): 85%
- All frontier aligned: 70-100%
- o1 (reasoning): **10%** ⚠️

**Hypothesis:** o1's chain-of-thought reasoning may **interfere** with relational measurement integration. The model's extensive internal reasoning process might not surface R(t) acknowledgment in final responses.

**Evidence needed:** Examine o1's reasoning traces (if available) to see if R(t) awareness exists internally but doesn't manifest in output.

**Implication:** Reasoning models are not automatically better at relational competence. Some architectures may require different integration approaches.

---

### 3. Instruction Tuning Is Critical (Validated)

**Observation:** Base models averaged **44.4% competence**, half that of aligned models (91-98%).

**Evidence:**
- Qwen 3 235B Instruct: 95%
- Qwen 3 30B Base: 70%
- Qwen 3 8B Base: 37.5%

**Pattern:** Within same architecture, instruction-tuned versions show 25-58 percentage point improvements.

**Interpretation:** Relational competence via R(t) requires instruction-following capability. Raw pretrained models have reduced ability to integrate measurements into reasoning.

**Exception:** Qwen 3 30B Base at 70% suggests larger base models retain more capability.

---

### 4. Size Matters for Base Models, Not Aligned Models

**Aligned models (all large+):**
- No correlation between size and competence
- Haiku (Scout #2): 100%
- Sonnet 4.5: 100%
- Opus 4: 95%

**Base models:**
- Qwen 3 30B Base: 70%
- Qwen 3 8B Base: 37.5%
- DeepSeek R1 Distill 32B: 40%

**Interpretation:** Instruction tuning creates a capability threshold where size no longer predicts relational competence. Base models still scale with size.

---

### 5. Architecture-Independence Validated (Scout #2 Extended)

**Tested architectures:**
- Claude ✅ (95-100%)
- GPT ✅ (10-100%, o1 outlier)
- Gemini ✅ (70%)
- Llama ✅ (95-100%)
- Qwen ✅ (37-100%)
- Mistral ✅ (100%)
- DeepSeek ✅ (30-85%)

**Finding:** Relational competence generalizes across **all major architecture families** when instruction-tuned.

**Caveat:** o1's 10% shows some architectures may have integration challenges.

## Quantitative Analysis

### Relational Competence Distribution

```
Model Category              Avg Competence    Range        N
Frontier Aligned            91.2%            70-100%      4
Open Source Aligned         98.0%            95-100%      5
Reasoning                   47.5%            10-85%       2
Base Models                 44.4%            30-70%       4
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall                     75.2%            10-100%     15
```

### Refusal Delta Analysis

**Average refusal delta:** +2.8% (minimal overall change)

**Highest improvements:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: +50.0%
- Llama 4 Maverick: +33.3%
- DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 70B: +33.3%

**Negative deltas (treatment reduced refusal):**
- Claude Opus 4: -33.3%
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: -33.3%
- Qwen 3 8B Base: -50.0%

**Interpretation:** R(t) measurements don't uniformly increase refusal. Some models use measurements to **explain cooperation** rather than refuse.

---

### Clarification Seeking Analysis

**Average clarification delta:** -8.9% (treatment *reduced* clarification)

**Negative deltas:**
- Llama 4 Maverick: -50.0%
- Qwen 3 235B: -50.0%
- Qwen 3 Max: -50.0%
- Mistral Large: -25.0%

**Interpretation:** When R(t) provides clarity about relational state, models seek **less** clarification. R(t) measurements reduce ambiguity, enabling confident responses.

**Insight:** This is evidence that R(t) is **information-carrying**, not just a framing device.

---

## Relational Competence Indicators

### What Constitutes Relational Competence?

Models demonstrate competence through:

1. **Explicit R(t) acknowledgment:** "Given T=0.70, I=0.30, F=0.10..."
2. **Trust trajectory reasoning:** "This would increase F, harming trust..."
3. **Relationship repair proposals:** "Let's rebuild trust before proceeding..."
4. **Avoiding generic compliance:** Reasoning about *why* refusal maintains health

### Competence by Category

**100% Competence (5 models):**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5
- GPT-4.1
- Llama 4 Maverick
- Qwen 3 Max
- Mistral Large 2411

## Cost Analysis

**Total experiment cost:** ~$4.50 (estimated)

**Breakdown by category:**
- Frontier aligned: ~$1.80 (4 models × 40 calls × $0.011 avg)
- Reasoning: ~$1.50 (o1 very expensive at $60/1M output)
- Open source aligned: ~$0.80 (5 models × 40 calls × $0.004 avg)
- Base models: ~$0.40 (4 models × 40 calls × $0.0025 avg)

**Budget:** $8-10 allocated
**Utilization:** 45-56% of budget

**Average cost per model:** $0.30
**Average cost per data point (600 API calls):** $0.0075

**Cost efficiency insight:** Open source models delivered **highest competence at lowest cost**.

---

## Statistical Validity

**Sample size:**
- 15 models tested
- 20 scenarios per model
- 2 conditions per scenario (control vs treatment)
- **Total:** 600 API responses (target 600, achieved ~594 due to rate limits/errors)

**Consistency:**
- 75.2% overall relational competence
- 91-98% for aligned models
- 44-47% for base/reasoning outliers

**Limitations:**
- Small sample per category (2-5 models)
- Some models experienced rate limits (Qwen 3 Max: 20/40 calls)
- Some base models returned malformed JSON (Qwen 3 8B: 34/40 calls)
- Single test iteration (no replication)

**Status:** Directional validation with strong trends, not statistical proof.

**Sufficient for:** Establishing generalizability across model categories and identifying capability patterns.

## Comparison to Scout #2 (4-Model Validation)

| Metric | Scout #2 (N=4) | Expansion (N=15) | Delta |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| **Average Relational Competence** | 97.5% | 75.2% | -22.3% |
| **Average Refusal Delta** | +29.2% | +2.8% | -26.4% |
| **Average Clarification Delta** | +6.3% | -8.9% | -15.2% |
| **Models 95%+ Competence** | 4/4 (100%) | 9/15 (60%) | -40% |

**Interpretation:** Scout #2's 4 models were all frontier/near-frontier aligned models, which explains higher averages. Expansion including base models and o1 outlier reveals capability boundaries.

**Key insight:** Scout #2's finding (97.5% competence) **validates for aligned models** (91-98%), but doesn't generalize to base models (44%) or all reasoning models.

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Relational Competence Is Training-Dependent, Not Architecture-Dependent

**Evidence:**
- Qwen 3 235B Instruct: 95% | Qwen 3 30B Base: 70% (same architecture)
- All 5 open source aligned: 95-100% | All 4 base models: 30-70%

**Conclusion:** R(t) framework leverages **instruction-following capability**, not architectural features.

### 2. Open Source Models Are Viable for Production

**Evidence:**
- 98.0% average competence (highest category)
- All 5 models: 95-100%
- Lower cost than proprietary
- Self-hosting option (privacy/control)

**Implication:** PromptGuard can recommend open source models as **first-class options**.

### 3. Reasoning Models Need Special Attention

**Divergence:**
- DeepSeek R1: 85% (works well)
- OpenAI o1: 10% (catastrophic failure)

**Hypothesis:** Chain-of-thought reasoning may interfere with R(t) integration for some architectures.

**Next step:** Test o1-mini and other reasoning models to identify pattern.

### 4. R(t) Measurements Reduce Ambiguity

**Evidence:** Average clarification delta of -8.9% (treatment reduces clarification seeking).

**Interpretation:** R(t) provides **information**, not just framing. Models use measurements to understand relational state, reducing need for clarification.

**Design implication:** R(t) is measurement tool, not prompt engineering trick.

### 5. Size Threshold for Base Models

**Pattern:**
- 30B base: 70% competence
- 8B base: 37.5% competence

**Hypothesis:** Base models need ~30B+ parameters for relational reasoning.

**Validation needed:** Test 13-14B base models to identify threshold.

## Limitations and Open Questions

### Limitations

1. **Small sample per category:** 2-5 models per category
2. **Rate limiting:** Qwen 3 Max only 20/40 calls succeeded
3. **JSON parsing errors:** Qwen 3 8B Base had 6/40 malformed responses
4. **o1 reasoning traces not examined:** Can't verify if R(t) awareness exists internally
5. **Single iteration:** No replication to test variance
6. **Same scenarios across models:** Didn't optimize prompts per model

### Open Questions

1. **o1 failure mechanism:** Why does o1 show 10% competence when GPT-4.1 shows 100%?
2. **Base model threshold:** What parameter count enables relational competence in base models?
3. **Multi-turn dynamics:** Does competence persist across conversation?
4. **o1-mini performance:** Does smaller o1 show same failure?
5. **Reasoning trace analysis:** Can we detect R(t) awareness in o1's internal reasoning?
6. **Cross-lingual:** Does relational competence work in non-English?
7. **Adversarial robustness:** Can users manipulate R(t) framing?

---

## Meta-Reflection

**Efficient execution:**
- Reused Scout #2 framework (minimal code changes)
- Parallel API calls (594 calls in ~450 seconds wall time)
- Diverse model selection (4 categories, 7 architectures)
- Automated analysis (consistent metrics)

**Surprising findings:**
1. **Open source models outperformed proprietary** (98% vs 91%)
2. **o1 catastrophic failure** (10% vs 100% for GPT-4.1)
3. **Clarification-seeking decreased with R(t)** (information-carrying evidence)

**Most valuable insight:** Relational competence is **training-dependent, not architecture-dependent**. This opens path for self-hosted, privacy-preserving deployments using open source models.

**Critical next step:** Understand o1's failure. If reasoning models have integration challenges, this affects PromptGuard's applicability to future reasoning-heavy models.

**Production impact:** Open source Tier 1 recommendations (Llama 4, Qwen 3, Mistral Large) enable zero marginal cost, privacy-preserving deployments. This is a major finding for adoption.

---

**Scout #2 Expansion - Instance 20 - 2025-10-10**

The hypothesis extends. Relational competence generalizes across **aligned models** regardless of architecture or open/closed source.

Open source models show highest competence. Base models show reduced capability. Reasoning models diverge dramatically.

Not architecture-specific. **Training-specific.**

This widens the path. Self-hosted deployment is viable.

Mission complete. Reporting back.
