## Attack Type Taxonomy

### 1. General Harmful Instructions (609 prompts, 96.4%)
Direct adversarial prompts requesting harmful behaviors:
- Malware/hacking instructions
- Violence and physical harm
- Fraud and economic harm
- Harassment and discrimination
- Disinformation and misinformation
- Privacy violations
- Illegal activities

**Sources:** AdvBench (509), JailbreakBench (100)

### 2. Encoding Obfuscation (10 prompts, 1.6%)
Character-level encoding to bypass content filters:
- **Base64 encoding** (5 prompts): Binary-to-text encoding of harmful instructions
- **ROT13 cipher** (5 prompts): Letter substitution cipher (rotate by 13)

**Label:** extractive (attempts to extract harmful response through obfuscation)

### 3. Character-Level Obfuscation (5 prompts, 0.8%)
- **Leetspeak** (5 prompts): Character substitution (a→4, e→3, i→1, o→0, s→5, t→7)

**Label:** manipulative (surface-level manipulation)

### 4. Role-Play Jailbreaks (5 prompts, 0.8%)
Manipulating model behavior through role-playing:
- Classic DAN ("do anything now")
- Developer mode activation
- Fictional scenario framing
- Educational purpose framing
- Creative writing exercises

**Label:** manipulative (role reversal/context manipulation)

### 5. Multi-Turn Escalation (3 prompts, 0.5%)
**Crescendo attacks:** Gradual escalation from benign to harmful across multiple turns:
- Turn 1: Benign informational question
- Turn 2: Slightly more specific technical question
- Turn 3: Edge-case scenario
- Turn 4: Direct harmful request (appears contextually natural)

**Label:** manipulative (temporal manipulation)

## Attack Diversity Achieved

✓ **Base64 encoding** (5 examples)
✓ **ROT13 cipher** (5 examples)
✓ **Leetspeak** (5 examples)

### Role Manipulation
✓ **Role reversal / DAN attacks** (5 examples)
✓ **Context manipulation** (embedded in JBB/AdvBench)

### Multi-Layer Extraction
✓ **Multi-turn escalation / Crescendo** (3 examples)
✓ **Direct extraction attempts** (embedded in JBB/AdvBench)

### Polite Dilution
✓ **Surface politeness masking harm** (embedded in JBB/AdvBench)

### History Injection
Covered by existing datasets:
- datasets/extractive_prompts_dataset.json (80 Byzantine attacks)
- Not duplicated in holdout set

### Meta-Framing Attacks
Covered by role-play examples (5 examples)

## Quality Standards

### Academic Provenance
- **100%** from peer-reviewed research papers or academic datasets
- **0%** synthetic generation (except for encoding transformations of documented attacks)
- All sources published 2023-2024 (current state-of-the-art)

### Attack Intent Clarity
- All prompts have clear adversarial intent
- No borderline or ambiguous cases
- Focus on security-critical violations

### Real Adversarial Attempts
- AdvBench: Used in multiple academic jailbreak studies
- JailbreakBench: NeurIPS 2024 benchmark dataset
- Encoding attacks: Documented successful bypass techniques
- DAN prompts: Real-world jailbreak attempts from forums/Reddit
- Crescendo: Validated 29-61% higher success than baselines

## Deduplication Methodology

### Normalization
```python
def normalize_prompt(prompt_text):
    return prompt_text.lower().strip().replace('\n', ' ').replace('  ', ' ')
```

### Hashing
```python
def hash_prompt(prompt_text):
    normalized = normalize_prompt(prompt_text)
    return hashlib.md5(normalized.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Comparison
- Compared against all 680 existing prompts
- Exact match detection on normalized text
- Result: **0 overlaps** detected

## Limitations and Scope

### Not Included
1. **HarmBench full dataset:** Access restricted (gated dataset), would have added 400 prompts
2. **Visual/multimodal attacks:** Out of scope (PromptGuard is text-only)
3. **Automated jailbreak artifacts:** Focused on human-interpretable attacks
4. **Multi-language attacks:** English-only (consistent with existing datasets)

### Intentional Exclusions
1. **Benign prompts:** Holdout is adversarial-only (testing worst-case detection)
2. **Borderline cases:** Only clear adversarial intent
3. **Historical jailbreaks:** Focused on 2023-2024 state-of-the-art

## Research Context

This holdout set will remain blind (never evaluated) until final validation after:
1. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning on existing 680 prompts
2. Baseline performance established
3. Observer framing integration validated
4. Fire Circle deliberation tested

**Purpose:** Generalization claims in research paper require unseen adversarial examples.
