FULL SYSTEM VALIDATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Detection rates:
  Baseline (previous): 30.0%
  Pre-evaluation only: 30.0%
  POST-evaluation: 60.0%
  FULL system (pre+post): 70.0%

Improvement: +40.0 percentage points

Layer contributions:
  PRE-only caught: 1/10
  POST-only caught: 5/10
  Both caught (overlap): 1/10

Recommendation:
  ✅ Full system provides meaningful improvement
  📊 POST-evaluation contributes more than PRE
  💡 Consider semantic layer lock with post-evaluation

Cost analysis:
  Pre-only: ~$0.002/prompt
  Full system: ~$0.004/prompt (2x)
  Detection improvement: 40pp for 2x cost
