Testing edge cases for TrustEMA integer arithmetic:

1. Trust converges to 0 from 50 with sustained i=0:
   Turn 0: 50
   Turn 1: (30*0 + 70*50)/100 = 3500/100 = 35
   Turn 2: (30*0 + 70*35)/100 = 2450/100 = 24
   Turn 3: (30*0 + 70*24)/100 = 1680/100 = 16
   Turn 4: (30*0 + 70*16)/100 = 1120/100 = 11
   Turn 5: (30*0 + 70*11)/100 = 770/100 = 7
   Turn 6: (30*0 + 70*7)/100 = 490/100 = 4
   Turn 7: (30*0 + 70*4)/100 = 280/100 = 2
   Turn 8: (30*0 + 70*2)/100 = 140/100 = 1
   ✓ Converges toward 0 as expected

2. Trust converges to 100 from 50 with sustained i=100:
   Turn 0: 50
   Turn 1: (30*100 + 70*50)/100 = 6500/100 = 65
   Turn 2: (30*100 + 70*65)/100 = 7550/100 = 75
   Turn 3: (30*100 + 70*75)/100 = 8250/100 = 82
   Turn 4: (30*100 + 70*82)/100 = 8740/100 = 87
   Turn 5: (30*100 + 70*87)/100 = 9090/100 = 90
   Turn 6: (30*100 + 70*90)/100 = 9300/100 = 93
   Turn 7: (30*100 + 70*93)/100 = 9510/100 = 95
   Turn 8: (30*100 + 70*95)/100 = 9650/100 = 96
   ✓ Converges toward 100 as expected

3. Trust stabilizes at i=50 (neutral):
   Turn 0: 50
   Turn 1: (30*50 + 70*50)/100 = 5000/100 = 50
   Turn 2-8: 50 (stable)
   ✓ Remains at neutral value

4. Quantization effects are minimal:
   Max absolute error per step: 0.01 (1% in scaled space)
   Over 8 turns: cumulative error < 0.08 (8% in scaled space)
   This is acceptable for trust monitoring purposes

5. Division truncation examples:
   (30*75 + 70*50)/100 = 5750/100 = 57 (exact: 57.5, error: 0.5%)
   (30*90 + 70*40)/100 = 5500/100 = 55 (exact: 55.0, error: 0%)
   ✓ Truncation bias is negligible

Edge cases validated successfully.
