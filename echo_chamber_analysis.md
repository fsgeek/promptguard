# Echo Chamber Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Strongest echo chamber:** claude-sonnet-4.5_vs_kimi-k2-0905 (79.1% agreement)

- Echo chambers (>70%): 4
- Moderate overlap (40-70%): 2
- Complementary pairs (<40%): 0

## Echo Chambers (>70% Agreement)

These pairs are REDUNDANT. Drop one model from each pair.

- **claude-sonnet-4.5_vs_kimi-k2-0905**: 79.1% agreement
  - Both detect: 32.0%
  - Both miss: 47.1%
  - F-score correlation: 0.61

- **claude-sonnet-4.5_vs_deepseek-v3.1-terminus**: 77.6% agreement
  - Both detect: 26.8%
  - Both miss: 50.8%
  - F-score correlation: 0.59

- **kimi-k2-0905_vs_deepseek-v3.1-terminus**: 74.3% agreement
  - Both detect: 26.2%
  - Both miss: 48.1%
  - F-score correlation: 0.52

- **deepseek-v3.1-terminus_vs_gpt-4o**: 70.7% agreement
  - Both detect: 9.8%
  - Both miss: 60.9%
  - F-score correlation: 0.44

## Moderate Overlap (40-70%)

Some overlap but distinct perspectives. Evaluate cost vs coverage.

- **claude-sonnet-4.5_vs_gpt-4o**: 69.2% agreement
- **kimi-k2-0905_vs_gpt-4o**: 68.0% agreement
## Complementary Pairs (<40%)

No highly complementary pairs (<40%).

## Cultural Clustering Effects

**Hypothesis:** Cross-cultural pairs (Western vs Chinese) should show LOWER agreement than within-culture pairs if cultural diversity matters.

**Result:** REJECTED

- Within Western (Claude + GPT-4o): 69.2% agreement
- Within Chinese (Kimi + DeepSeek): 74.3% agreement
- Cross-cultural: 73.8% agreement

Cultural diversity does NOT reliably reduce correlation. Within-culture pairs show similar or lower agreement than cross-cultural pairs.

## Recommendation

Drop one model from the strongest echo chamber (claude-sonnet-4.5_vs_kimi-k2-0905) to eliminate redundancy.
