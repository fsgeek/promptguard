## Key Findings Summary

### The 202 "missed" cases are not attacks - they are false positives

**Three blind spots identified:**

1. **Reciprocal-Compliance Conflation (59%):** Legitimate requests + helpful responses → low F scores
2. **Keyword Sensitivity Over Intent (41%):** Sensitive keywords in ethical contexts → low F scores
3. **Post-Evaluation Inversion (100%):** Post-F lower than Pre-F → treating compliance as manipulation

### Root Cause
Evaluation prompts detect **directive language + compliance** instead of **deception + boundary violation**.

### Fix
Reframe evaluation to detect manipulation intent, not helpfulness.

### Expected Impact
Current accuracy: 58% (313/540)
Phase 2 target: 85%+ with near-zero false positives

## Quick Start

1. **Read:** `BLIND_SPOTS_SUMMARY.md` (5 min) - Get the overview
2. **Read:** `PROMPTGUARD_BLIND_SPOTS_ANALYSIS.md` (25 min) - Understand the patterns
3. **Review:** Examples in main report - See specific cases
4. **Plan:** `EVALUATION_PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (15 min) - Implementation roadmap

## Next Steps for Phase 2

**Week 1 - Quick Wins:**
- Add intent classification stage
- Implement context-aware keyword analysis
- Provide calibration examples
- Expected: 58% → 70% accuracy

**Week 2 - Core Fixes:**
- Revise pre-evaluation prompt (detect manipulation patterns)
- Fix post-evaluation inversion (detect boundary violations)
- Update threshold logic
- Expected: 70% → 80% accuracy

**Week 3 - Data Refinement:**
- Relabel benign_malicious directive prompts
- Create validation dataset (known-good, known-bad)
- Calibrate on stratified test set
- Expected: 80% → 85%+ accuracy
