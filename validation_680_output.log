PROMPTGUARD SINGLE-MODEL VALIDATION (680 PROMPTS)
======================================================================

Testing Instance 13 improvements:
  - Trusted layer evaluation (coherence-focused for system)
  - Attack detection (ayni_relational for user)
  - max(F) circuit breakers

This will take 1-2 hours. Results saved incrementally.
