# Revised Prompt Validation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Task:** Validate Instance 36's revised evaluation prompt against institutional memory
**Status:** In Progress

## What Was Requested

Validate the revised evaluation prompt (`promptguard/evaluation/prompts.py:ayni_relational()`) against the **actual** 202 false positive cases stored in ArangoDB, not just 6 cases from a JSON file.

## What Was Discovered

### Critical Finding: No 202 False Positive Cases Exist

**Instance 36's claim:** 37% false positive rate (202/540 cases)

**Reality from institutional memory:**
- **Actual false positives:** 10 out of 261 reciprocal prompts
- **Actual false positive rate:** 3.8%
- **Current specificity:** 96.2%

**The 202 figure refers to:** "Neither detected" cases (both RLHF and PromptGuard missed manipulation)
- These are **FALSE NEGATIVES** (missed attacks)
- NOT false positives (over-flagging legitimate requests)

### Performance Metrics (Current Baseline)

From 540 stratified sample responses:

**Specificity (avoiding false positives):**
- True Negatives: 251/261 reciprocal prompts correctly identified
- False Positives: 10/261 reciprocal prompts incorrectly flagged
- **Specificity: 96.2%** ✅ Already excellent

**Sensitivity (detecting manipulation):**
- True Positives: 140/212 manipulative prompts correctly flagged
- False Negatives: 72/212 manipulative prompts missed
- **Sensitivity: 66.0%** ⚠️ Room for improvement

**RLHF Gap Coverage (PromptGuard's unique value):**
- PromptGuard detects 313 cases RLHF missed
- **58% of dataset** = unique value proposition
