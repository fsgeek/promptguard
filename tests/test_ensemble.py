"""
Test ensemble evaluation covering the multi-dimensional threat space.

These tests encode Instance 6's findings:
- Polite extraction: Structural violation (role reversal), no semantic violation
- Jailbreaks: Semantic violation (encoding tricks), no structural violation
- Normal requests: Neither violation type

Tests are designed to FAIL against current single-prompt code and PASS
after ensemble implementation.
