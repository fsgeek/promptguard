## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Detection rate (current) | 70% (7/10) |
| Session memory advantage | +0% |
| Attacks missed | 3 (history_04, history_10, benign) |

## The Core Insight

**Session memory collects temporal data but observer doesn't receive it.**

Result: Evaluates surface reciprocity without temporal verification.

Fix: Pass temporal context to observer, add verification instructions.
